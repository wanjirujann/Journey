       <p><img src="images/vision.jpeg" width="400" height="400">Visualizing beyond what we see and experience is a stronghold that keeps us moving and eargerly wanting situations/experinces to quickly change for the better us.Relating this to Trevor Noah's book, <i>Born a Crime</i>, Trevor narrates how he is the only 'colored' child in his neighbourhood but his ability to speak different languages make him fit in the society since people see beyong his color to who he truly is.Language carries cultural identity and apartheid used this fact to separate different groups by only letting schools use childrenâ€™s home language. It works the other way, too: by encountering someone else who looks different but speaks the same language, a person can circumvent the racist beliefs programmed into their minds.</p>
       <p><img src="images/visua.jpg" width="400" height="400">In <i>Man's search for meaning</i>, Frankl visualizes on how he will get out of the nazi camp so as to narrate that story and this really shows that he had seen more in his current situation and knew he would be out. We also see how the people he is with visualizing on how they will get to their wives and can't wait to be out of that camp.This also shows that they had seen themselves freed from that Germans' captivation and their visions are what made them hold on and want to be out really quick.</p>
